You have to develop a web application that manages an auction house.

> Step 1 - Auction house
Create an auction house with a given name.
List all auction houses created.
Delete a specific house.

> Step 2 - Auction
For a given Auction house
- create an auction with some parameters: name, description, starting time, end time, start
price, current price
- List all auctions for a given auction house
- Delete a specific auction
- (Optional): List all auctions based on their status (i.e. not_started, running, terminated,
deleted, ...)

> Step 3 - Bidding in an auction
For a given auction:
- Let a specific user bid (if only the bidding price is higher that the auction current price and
the auction is started)
- List all bidding (with the user name) that has happen until now
- For a terminated auction, show the winner (i.e. the bidder that puts the higher price)

> Notes
- This must be a web application that receives and answer to http commands with tools like
cURL or HTTPie
- You can use any library you want
- Database and persistent mechanisms are not asked, you can keep all data in memory
- You can use the domain model (POJO) you want as long as it solves the exercice

> Optional points
- Use of a build system (like maven or gradle)
- Good management or user notifications of errors
- Use of appropriate http requests methods
- Clean code
- Tests
- Documentation
